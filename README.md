## Features in Detail

### Product List
- Products are fetched from the API (`http://localhost:5000/api`) using `useEffect` and displayed in a grid layout.
- A custom hook (`useProductList`) manages product data fetching and state.

### Product Detail
- Users can view detailed product information by clicking on an item in the Product List.
- Product are fetched based on the product ID received from URL parameters.

### Cart Functionality- Cart state is managed with Redux.
- Users can add products to the cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- The cart summary calculates the total price dynamically.

### Search Feature
 A search input allows users to filter products by name. The filtered product list is displayed based on the search query.

    - `/`: Home (Product List)
    - `/products/:id`: Product Detail
    - `/cart`: Cart
    - `/checkout`: Checkout
    - `/account`: Account creation page
    - `*`: NotFound page for undefined routes

### Error Handling
- Basic error handling is in place for API fetch failures.
- User feedback is provided for missing or invalid input.

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading are utilized through `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for enhanced performance.

### Responsiveness
- The application design adapts well to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management for handling global app state.
- **React Router**: For routing between application views.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **CSS**: For application styling.
